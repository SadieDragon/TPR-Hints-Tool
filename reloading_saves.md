Hi, hello, I wrote the save functions but I hit a pretty bad burnout spell and I have not been able to force myself to finish the other half of this.

You can save your notes and progress, but you currently cannot reload it from the app itself. I am sorry.

In order to reload your saved information, go to ``Saves``, which is a folder in this directory, and look for the latest time stamp.  
Time stamps are ``month-day-year (hour-minute)``.  
You do not need to unzip the archive, you do not need to delete it; the app will delete archives when there are more than 5 in this folder. Just, click on it to open it, and File Explorer should open it.  
The easy option is to just use ``master.txt``, but you could open each tab's file and copy the info from there as well.

For a notepad tab, just copy the text in the section and paste it into the tab.  
For a checklist tab, ``True`` means it was checked off, ``False`` means that it was not.

Again: I am sorry. I don't know when I'll have the energy to fix this.
