# This is a log file for the things that I have done.

It is written for my memory purposes when writing changelogs. It is provided for clarity when I ask for help.

Please note that I will reset this between releases, to keep it organized.

If you see a blank line between bullets on any given day, it means that I rolled over to the next day, and went to sleep somewhere in the region.

# To-Do

**Tasks which I recognize I need to do- I will forget to add things here, and I am sorry in advance.**

- I have a lot of random newlines in the markdowns. It's either that, or super long lines. Make that uniform.
    - When I do, make sure to go back through and update every python file reference to have the full path.
- Give these files a better name
    - ``title.py``
- update all ``x = Class`` to ``x: Class`` (thanks @Ecconia for pointing this out)
- bug squish time!
- prettify the code
