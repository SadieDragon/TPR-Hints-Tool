# This is a log file for the things that I have done.

It is written for my memory purposes when writing changelogs.  
It is provided for clarity when I ask for help.

Please note that I will reset this between releases, to keep it organized.

**July 28, 2024**
- Restructured ``.gitignore`` to be a bit smarter when it comes to me muting files for testing purposes.
- Created ``log.md`` to help scan through my often poorly named commits, to aide in future requests for help.
    - I hope that it will make it easier to scan the commits, and understand what I was trying to achieve in a commit.
