Hi. If you see this and heard I was taking a week off...

My brain had a one-day blip of WOO ROCKET FUEL I HAVE TONS OF IDEAS I MUST CODE
Given that's been p. rare recently... I took advantage of the steam

This branch isn't even fully working right now. I ran out of steam at the end.

"Hotfix 0.2b???"
I name any not-inherently-next-patch releases a hotfix for one thing
for another, i really do not want yet another "It's just a massive refactor" patch
it might become 0.3
but I really, really, really, wanna get saving working.

Ecconia called out the code was a bit too cagey, not his words but the gist i got from the feedback
and i agree on lookback
I don't think this really fixed it
i hope it made it better

fun fact..
you can see me runnin out of steam if you look through the commits

ok
good night
idk when i'll be back to work on this
by the end of next week for sure
