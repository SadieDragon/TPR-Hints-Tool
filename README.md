If you see this, I did not finish my lofty goals by July 6, 2024, and released a basic program. Therefore, it ain't packaged yet. Sorry.

(Or I made the repo public prior and thus have this on main so no one comes by and is confused.)

__To 'install' this program:__
- Install python. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - If you are on any unix distros (mac, you too), you will likely need to install tkinter if you get an error later while trying to run this. I will not provide tips, you unix people should know how this works :P (and mac I have no idea, google it?)
- Click on the ``<> Code`` button, and you'll see a dropdown. Click on the ``download zip`` option.
- Extract your zip somewhere.
    - Do not close File Explorer, it will help in the ``how to run``

__To run this program:__
- Windows (10):
    - copy the path from the FileExplorer window
        - You see that bar above ``Name``, ``Date Modified``, etc? Click, then ctrl+C
    - open command prompt
        - click the search icon on your task bar and type in "command", it should pop up
    - Type in ``cd`` then press ctrl+v to paste the path.
    - ``python3 hintstool.py`` - tab complete will be your friend

__How to use this program:__
- Right now, this is just a gloried notepad. I provided an extra tab for Agitha, so you could use that to mock up a checklist.

One glance at the rest of the repo, and you can tell that there's much more planned. I do apologize for the slight delay.
If you want to play around with the in-progress code before release, follow the above steps for the ``hint-tool-(not-mvc)`` branch. Be warned that that is live and being updated regularly, so code *might* be broken if I've pushed an update to update an issue.
