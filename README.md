__Please read 'reloading_saves.md' for using the save functions.__

__Contact me if you find bugs:__
- I would like to keep issues for things I have posted myself, given I have a lot of irons in the fire and have made a mess of them. There's a discussion page for bug reports, though, and this would be the preferred location for them.
    - https://github.com/SadieDragon/TPR-Hints-Tool/discussions/categories/bug-reports
- Discord is the best not-GitHub way to get my attention more directly. There is a discord server for this project.

__To 'install' this program:__
- Install Python. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download the release.
    - https://github.com/SadieDragon/TPR-Hints-Tool/releases
- Extract the zip somewhere somehow, there are multiple ways.
- Navigate to the extracted folder, and install the required packages.
    - ``python -m pip install --upgrade pip``
    - ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

__To use this program:__
- Move your downloaded seed's spoiler log to the folder named SpoilerLog
    - Remove spoiler logs as you complete them.
- Click on ``main.py``, and the program *should* run.
    - If it does not, please, contact me and let me know, because this means
    there was a bug.
    - I will be writing a script in the near future to make this a bit easier.

__(Unorganized) To-Do:__
- Improvizations to the shopping list tabs
  - Improve handling for the varying hint strengths
    - If you use stronger hints, and get a bug, please join the discord and
    report it under the #bug-reports channel.
  - Combine jovani with the other minor shopping lists (Fishing Hole Bottle,
  COO, maybe etc?)
  - Improve the default pages for them to be a dropdown based checklist
  instead of a notepad
- Reloading Saves
- A key tool that helps you figure out what an unrequired key makes barren
- A tool to help you mark down where the big key is for a dungeon, if your hint signs include it, and any small keys that you get hints for.
- Package better for end users
  - Write a temporary file that allows you to more easily create a desktop
  shortcut and run this program.
  - Pre-package this into a .exe file - I have done testing, and there are some
  issues that arise with the user input

Next planned release as of writing: [No release date planned] for [Release 1.0]
